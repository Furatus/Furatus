Hi, Iâ€™m @Furatus

I'm a student in computer science, learning programming and other things

Feel free to use my code as much as you want (as an exemple or for your own business), but please note that it isn't mean to be used in commercial cases, or more advanced projects.

Don't bother to make pull requests or issues, as i will probably never fix them nor push a newer version when my student project is done.

Most of my projects are licensed for now by GPL 2 or 3 (or LGPL)

I'm not a english native speaker, so i apologize already for the mistakes i could make in descriptions like this one or comments on push. (for those who are wondering i'm french)

Thanks for your attention :-)
